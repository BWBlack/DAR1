# Dar_One Beginner Tutorial

BEFORE YOU START:

Follow the setup guide for using the [dar_one_docker image](../README.md/#setting-up-with-docker) or  
for [local machine setup](../README.md/#setting-up-on-local-machine). (HIGHLY recommend using docker over setting up your own machine) 

## Building

If you're using dar_one_docker...
- you don't have to do anything! I already built the mitgcm executable for the docker container
- the executable is called `mitgcmuv` and lives in the `darwin3/verification/dar_one_config/build` directory
