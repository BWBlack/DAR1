# Setup

# Example

# Contributing 

We have three main branches
- main
- test
- dev 

All other branches are feature branches. Once a feature has been implemented, tested, and documented you can make a pull request to merge it into the `dev` branch. From there, it will be deployed (hopefully in the future). If the deploy passes, it will automatically get merged into the `test` branch. 

This branch is for people who deeply understand the code and want to beta test new features. Once apropriate testing and tutorials have been created, there will be a merge planned for `main`. 

`main` is the most recent and stable version of the code. This branch will be deployed to cloud computing resources and publically available.
