# Case Study A - Bottle Experiment 

A simple nutrient amendment experiment. 

In this experiment, DAR1 is initialized with values from a global DARWIN run, provided HERE [link]. Initial parameter values were X=203 and Y=108 (lon = 203.5, lat = 28.5). In the control run, nothing was modified. For the bottle experiment run, nitrate values were increased 10x. 

The initial parameters that were set include all nutrient tracers (TRAC01-TRAC20), all biomass tracers excluding diazotrophs (TRAC21-TRAC29, TRAC35-TRAC70), PAR, and temperature.
